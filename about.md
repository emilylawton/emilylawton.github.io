I am a [software engineer](https://github.com/emilylawton) at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) in the Greater Seattle Area. I am currently working on core Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning components to achieve deep understanding of human textual communications (email) in the Microsoft Search, Assistant, and Intelligence org. I spend my free time [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35429450-emily), [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/9428841), [practicing guitar](https://soundcloud.com/lawtem/tracks), writing about [music](https://www.angrymetalguy.com/author/emya/) and [travel](https://medium.com/@emlawton), and struggling to satisfy my insatiable curiosity for all things music.
