I am a [software engineer](https://github.com/emilylawton) at Microsoft [Cortana](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana) in the Greater Seattle Area. I spend my free time [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35429450-emily), [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/9428841), [practicing guitar](https://soundcloud.com/lawtem), and struggling to satisfy my insatiable curiosity for all things music.
