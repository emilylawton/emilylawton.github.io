title: Eugene Marathon Training Week 3 
comments: true

I enjoy running and the process of setting goals and executing on training plans. I also love to write so I thought it might be enjoyable and worthwhile to document my progress while training for the 2020 Eugene Marathon. Though I have been running since middle school, I have only trained for and completed one marathon so far. My first was the Beat the Blerch Marathon in Carnation, WA in 2016. My primary goal with running Beat the Blerch was to both get to the start line healthy and complete the race. While I struggled a bit to put in the weekly mileage I wanted to hit as a result of being totally wiped out from the weekly long runs, I ran the race conservatively and finished in 4:20:31.

For the Eugene Marathon, my goals are slightly more ambitious. I am incorporating more strength work into my routine and am doing my best to avoid making the mistake I made during my training for Beat the Blerch in which the percentage of my weekly mileage that I packed into my weekend long runs was way too high (sometimes as high as 60 - 75%). 

#### A Goal: Sub 3:30 
#### B Goal: Sub 4:00 
#### C Goal: Get to the finish line! 

### Week 3 Training Log

**Thursday**: 7 miles easy - slight twinge in my right quad - keeping up my glute exercises to keep this at bay<br />
**Friday**: Rest<br />
