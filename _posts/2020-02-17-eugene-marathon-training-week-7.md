A niggle in my left ankle combined with my upcoming Austin half marathon race on Sunday meant I ran pretty low mileage throughout the week. I was diligent about doing foot/ankle strength exercises after running through some discomfort in my long run last Sunday. The rest and strength work served me well. I was feeling fresh and excited for the race by the time the weekend rolled around. 

Overall, I was very pleased with my results on Sunday. I woke around 5:30am, scarfed down new favorite pre-race meal: Picky Bars Performance Oatmeal, and made it to the start line with my boyfriend and our friend. As thhe sun came up, the weather was shaping up to be as good as I could hope for - cool and cloudy, though extremely humid. We assembled at the start line near the 4:05 marathon pacer. Looking back, I regret not starting further up in the field. I spent too much energy in the first several miles weaving in and out of people. 

The gun finally went off (the race unfortunately started a good 40 minutes after the official 7:00am start time), and I was filled with excitement to see what I could do on that day. I hoping for a sub-1:50 and a PR, but given that I was having ankle troubles earlier in the week I had mentally relaxed my goals to sub-2:00. As each mile went by without discomfort, I grew more confident and knew that a PR was possible. 

Mile 1 (8:54): Taking it especially easy since the first three miles are uphill, just working on getting around the crowds<br />
Mile 2 (8:38): Still weaving through hordes of people<br />
Mile 3 (8:26): STILL weaving<br />
Mile 4 (8:17): Finally starting to get into a rhythm, the downhill is feeling great after three miles of gentle but steady uphill <br />
Mile 5 (8:05): Cruise control. I swipe up a salty banana from a spectator and get an energy boost. <br />
Mile 6 (8:12): I feel like I'm flying.<br />
Mile 7 (8:16): Still soaring. Turning onto W Cesar Chavez St was my favorite part of the race. The spectators came in droves and were screaming loud. I usually listen to music while running but ended carrying my headphones with me the entire race and fed off of the cheering from the crowds instead of listening to one of my running playlists. <br />
Mile 8 (8:22): Quieter part of the race, still feeling suspiciously good. I tried to grab nuun at every single aid station since it was so humid out. I couldn't tell if my skin was wet because of the humidity in the air or the fact that I was sweating so profusely. <br />
Mile 9 (8:27): My mind started wandering here but I did my best to stay focused and repeat various mantras. The spectators had great posters out there for inspiration! <br />
Mile 10 (8:19): The steep hill in this mile as we turned onto Enfield Road was rough, but I was energized by how many people I passed on it. <br />
Mile 11: (8:06): I enjoyed the rolling hills here. I started to pick up the pace because I knew I still had a lot left in the tank. <br />
Mile 12: (7:59): Keeping calm and continuing to push the past. <br />
Mile 13: (7:33): Exhaustion finally begins to set in. The last hill was brutal. I did my best to push through. <br />
.1: (7:16): Total exhaustion. I felt every muscle in my legs but finished as strong as I could. <br />
