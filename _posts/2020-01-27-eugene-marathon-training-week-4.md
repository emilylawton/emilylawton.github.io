This week, I maintained the same intensity as last week but reduced my weekly mileage slightly to make sure I recover before I ramp up mileage next week. I felt surprisingly fresh on Sunday! Maybe it was the new running shoes. Perhaps the soft, dirt trails in Discovery Park did my legs some good on Saturday. I'm savoring the feeling now, because I don't anticipate feeling the same way a week from now. Onwards and upwards. 

**Monday**: Yoga + core - hip flexors brutally sore from skiing<br />
**Tuesday**: 4.5 miles easy on the treadmill<br />
**Wednesday**: 5.5 miles (1.5 mile warmup, 5 x 800 between 7 and 7:30 pace with 2 min rest, 1.5 mile cooldown) + strength work<br />
**Thursday**: 7 miles easy + core<br />
**Friday**: Rest<br />
**Saturday**: 3.7 mile easy trail run with Oiselle at Discovery Park<br />
**Sunday**: 7 miles (1 mile warmup, 5 miles hard at 7:40 - 7:45 pace, 1 mile cooldown) + core

**Total Mileage**: 27.8
